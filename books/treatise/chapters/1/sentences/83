text: "The occasion on which our Blessed Lord and Saviour spake these words, For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts â€” was this; The Scribes and Pharisees, who were the teachers and expounders of the Jewish Law, and whose business it was to give the true meaning of it, instead of that did grossly pervert the real design, sense, and meaning of it, put erroneous and false glosses upon it, and many times imposed their own traditions upon the people in the place of it."
